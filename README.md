# Word Counting using High Performace Computing
To parallelize the problem of counting the number of words in a text, the OpenMP Application Program Interface
is used to direct ***multi-threaded, shared memory parallelism***.

The dataset used to count the number of words is taken from *wordlist.10000* created by https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
